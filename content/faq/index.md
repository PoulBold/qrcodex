## General

### **What is QR Codex?**
QR Codex is an educational platform that provides clear, human-friendly explanations of QR codes, barcodes, scanning systems, and related technologies.

### **Is the content free?**
Yes. All informational materials, guides, and explanations are free to read.

## QR Codes

### **How do QR codes work?**
A QR code stores binary data in a two-dimensional matrix. When scanned, the device reads the module pattern, applies error correction, and decodes the content into text, URLs, or other formats.

### **What can a QR code store?**
QR codes can store short text, URLs, contact cards, Wi-Fi credentials, email templates, SMS messages, calendar events, and geographic coordinates—up to roughly 3 KB.

### **Why won’t my QR code scan?**
Typical reasons include low contrast, poor print quality, small size, reflective surfaces, damaged modules, or insufficient lighting.

### **Do QR codes expire?**
Static QR codes do not expire. Dynamic QR codes can change or be deactivated depending on the service provider.

## Barcodes

### **Are QR codes the same as barcodes?**
No. Barcodes are one-dimensional and store data using bars and spaces. QR codes are two-dimensional and can store more data with higher fault tolerance.

### **What barcode type should I use?**
For retail: UPC or EAN.  
For logistics: Code 128 or Code 39.  
For books: ISBN/EAN-13.  
Each standard serves a specific purpose.

### **Which QR scanner app is recommended?**

- i-nigma
- Google Lens
- Native Camera App (iOS)

### **Why do some scanners read faster than others?**
Differences in camera quality, decoding algorithms, autofocus speed, and error-correction implementation.
