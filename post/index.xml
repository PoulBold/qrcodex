&lt;p&gt;Although both QR codes and barcodes serve one purpose — &lt;strong&gt;identifying or linking information&lt;/strong&gt; — they differ dramatically in structure, capacity, flexibility, and the way scanners read them. Understanding these differences helps businesses choose the right technology for logistics, retail, marketing, and digital interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a comprehensive, easy-to-understand comparison tailored for modern use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;barcode&lt;/strong&gt; (also called a linear or 1D code) is a series of vertical black lines and spaces of varying widths. It stores information horizontally — in &lt;strong&gt;one dimension&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR codes have evolved far beyond their original role in factories. Today, they are everywhere: on restaurant tables, delivery packages, billboards, medical documents, product boxes, and even business cards. The reason is simple — QR codes act as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, enabling instant access to information with a single scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a comprehensive overview of how QR codes function across different industries and why they became such an essential tool in the modern digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR codes have become a universal tool — from restaurant menus and product packaging to payments and authentication. But few people know where they came from or how they work on a technical level. This guide explains the full story: why QR codes were invented, who created them, and how the underlying system encodes information so quickly and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
